<!--  Specify the name of your video in the href- attribute below. You uploaded this in step 2e; in this example it is an .mp4 file
     When playing mp4s, you must write it as you see it below--mp4:NAME_OF_FILE (Note the .mp4 file extension is removed) -->
<a class="rtmp" href="mp4:war_on_wheels/VTS_01_0.m4v" />

<!--  Specify your splash image. Be sure it is the same size as your player.
This code is optional — if you do not want a splash image, erase this line. -->

<!--Common problems:
-	You cannot have any spaces in any of your URL's (including your 'rtmp://...'  URL)				(i.e.,  http:// thereisaspaceatthebeginninghere.xxx) 
-	Be sure you are calling the correctly numbered version of the flowplayer objects/players (i.e. flowplayer-3.2.2.swf
-	You cannot have duplicates of 's3.amazonaws.com' or 'cloudfront.net' in the same address (i.e. (http://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.amazonaws.com/YOUR_BUCKET/player.swf)
-	There is a different naming protocol for mp4 vs flv files. For .mp4 files, YOU MUST write it as 'mp4:YOUR_VIDEO_FILE_WITHOUT_THE _MP4_SUFFIX'. For .flv files, you simply write the name of the file, 'YOUR_VIDEO_FILE_WITHOUT_THE_FLV_SUFFIX'.
