JW Player for HTML5
===================


Introduction
------------

The JW Player for HTML5 is a fully skinneable and configurable player based upon the new <video> tag found in HTML5. It is built using javascript (`jQuery <http://jquery.org'>`_). Since HTML5 support is currently not widespread, the player integrates a seamless fallback to the popular `JW Player for Flash <http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-flv-player/>`_.

The player can be skinned using PNG images, which makes it extremely easy to modify both the behaviour and looks. The player is fully compatible with the `PNG skinning model <http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player/jw-player-for-flash-v5/14/skinning-the-jw-player-5>`_ of our Flash player, so you can leverage the `existing repository <http://www.longtailvideo.com/addons/skins/>`_ of available skins.
